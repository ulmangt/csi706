1-4,6,7
monitorSC,monitorSU (given on exam)
unexpected results
critical section problem
bounded waiting
solve problem with semaphores then monitorSC then monitorSU
integer / vector timestamp
race set / race table
reachability testing


five questions

events after dotted lines are always white -- new events which were not in the variant

only color events which changed black (and any events before it)

Also note in practice problem, switching the events on T3/T4 causes new events / mutex operations on mutex1

in V1 we don't consider the T1/T2 race to be changed 
but we have new races between T4 / T2 and T4 / T1



V1 race set -- columns indicate events

  receive 1 (mutex1)     receive 2 (mutex1)
------------------------------------------
V4       1                        -1
V5       0                         1



In V3, mutex 1 P operation will be black, so new send from T4
will be ignorred
