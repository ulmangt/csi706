We believe the BarrierSynchronization code is correct.

It passes the deadlock detection and reachability testing tool without errors.

The "baton" passing approach used makes reasoning about the program's behavior more tractable:

As threads call waitB() for the first time, they block on queue.P() until the last thread arrives.

Instead of queuing up, this thread calls queue.V() to wake up one of the waiting threads and exits
the critical section without calling mutex.V() (thus "passing the baton" to the thread it woke up).
Because the critical section stays locked, even if this thread (or any thread woken up during the
chained wake up described below) immediately calls waitB() again, it will block at the mutex.P()
call until all threads have finished waking up and the barrier is ready for use again.

The first thread which is woken up after all have reached the barrier assumes that it is inside the
critical section and checks the current count of waiting threads. If their are more to wake, it calls
queue.V() and exits the critical section without calling mutex.V() (again "passing the baton" to the
next blocked thread). This continues until the last thread is woken. This thread simply calls
mutex.V() to finally leave the critical section.

At this point, count is back to 0, no thread is blocked on queue.P(), and no one is in the critical
section. The Barrier is ready for use again.
