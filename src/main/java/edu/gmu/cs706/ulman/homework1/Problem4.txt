Problem 4 - Exercise 2.10

Because T1 does not immediately see T0's writes and vice versa, the following instruction
ordering can occur which violates mutual exclusion. Therefore, Peterson's Algorithm can
fail if write buffers like those described in Exercise 2.10 are used.

T0                T1                 Comments
---------------------------------------------
(1)                                  intendToEnter0 write is placed in buffer
(2)                                  turn write is placed in buffer
(3)                                  intendToEnter1 = false, so T0 does not enter while loop
(4)                                  T0 enters critical section
   ---> context switch
                  (1)                intendToEnter1 write is placed in buffer
                  (2)                turn write is placed in buffer
                  (3)                intendToEnter0 write is still in buffer, so T1 still sees
                                     intentToEnter0 = false and does not enter while loop
                  (4)                T1 enters critical section
